Simple Web frontend for Irc It!

This web script implements an easy way to chat over an existing *ii* session.
Just W3C standard are used for this implementation.  Edit *chat.css* to
customize the style of this chat front end.

The C implementations of the cgi scripts should be used within a chrooted
webserver.  So no shell utils have to be inside of the chroot directory.
